## Commands

This repo has already a scaffold of a basic component library.

The recommended workflow is to run in one terminal:

```
yarn start # or npm start
```

This loads the stories from `./stories`.

> NOTE: Stories should reference the components as if using the library. This means importing from the root project directory. This has been aliased in the tsconfig and the storybook webpack config as a helper.

## Configuration

Code quality is setup with `prettier`, `husky`, and `lint-staged`. Adjust the respective fields in `package.json` accordingly.

### Jest

Jest tests are set up to run with `yarn test` or `npm test`. This runs the test watcher (Jest) in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### TypeScript

`tsconfig.json` is set up to interpret `dom` and `esnext` types, as well as `react` for `jsx`. Adjust according to your needs.
